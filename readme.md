# CW Redirect Component for Joomla

CW Redirect enables you to create a simple redirect by creating a Joomla menu item. Redirect the user from `yoursite.com/menu-item-alias` to any link you choose.

This component makes it easier than ever to redirect users from a URL on your site to any URL on the internet. Simply create a CW Redirect menu item, and CW Redirect turns that menu item into a 301 redirect to whatever URL you choose.

* Create a URL redirect by simply creating a menu item
* Redirect to any URL, not just internal URL's
* Shorten your URL's. Redirect `yoursite.com/short-blog-post-title` to `yoursite.com/blog/some-category/123-long-blog-post-title`
